## Introduction

In the realm of natural language processing, understanding token trajectories can provide insights into how models interpret and generate language. **Logitloom** is designed to visualize these trajectories, helping researchers and developers analyze model behavior effectively.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Easily explore token trajectories with our intuitive interface.
- **Support for Multiple Models**: Analyze both instruct and base models to compare their behavior.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust settings to focus on specific aspects of token interactions.
- **Data Export**: Save your findings for further analysis or reporting.

## Usage

Once you have installed **Logitloom**, you can start exploring token trajectories. Hereâ€™s how to use the application:

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the application using the command mentioned in the installation section.
2. **Select a Model**: Choose between instruct and base models from the dropdown menu.
3. **Input Your Text**: Enter the text you want to analyze in the provided text box.
4. **Visualize**: Click the "Visualize" button to generate the token trajectory tree.
5. **Explore**: Navigate through the tree to see how tokens interact and evolve.

## Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing Simple Sentences

Input: "The cat sat on the mat."

- The token trajectory tree will display how each token influences the others.
- You can observe the relationships and dependencies among tokens.

### Example 2: Complex Sentences

Input: "Although the weather was bad, we decided to go for a walk."

- This example will show a more intricate token interaction.
- You can analyze how conditional phrases affect the overall structure.
